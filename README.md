## Travel Recommendation System using Neo4j
## Overview

The Travel Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized travel suggestions to users based on their preferences, past visits, and social connections. By leveraging graph-based relationships between users, activities, places, and friends, the system delivers recommendations tailored to each user’s interests and social network.

## Key Features

User Preferences: Users can input the types of activities they enjoy (e.g., hiking, beach parties) and favorite places.  

Social Influence: Recommendations consider friends’ preferences and visited places, providing suggestions influenced by social connections.  

Activity \& Place Recommendations: The system suggests activities at places that match users’ past visits, likes, and friends’ interactions.  

Graph Database Model: Neo4j is used to model complex relationships, enabling efficient and meaningful recommendations.

## Data Model

The system uses a graph database modelwith the following core nodes and relationships:  
Nodes: Users, Activities, Places  
Relationships: 
 Users → Likes → Activities  

 Users → Visited → Places  

 Users → Friends → Users  

 Places → Offers → Activities  

This structure allows queries that combine user preferences, social connections, and location-based activities for personalized recommendations.

## Implementation

Database:Neo4j  

Key Cypher Queries: 

- Finding recommended activities based on user preferences and friends’ likes  

- Suggesting new places to visit based on visited places of friends  

- Ranking recommendations by social influence and interest match  

Sample Flow: 

1. A user enters their preferences.  

2. The system queries the graph for matching activities and places.  

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of graph databases in modeling complex relationships for personalized travel suggestions. By analyzing user interests, visited places, and social connections, the system provides meaningful recommendations.  

The project lays the foundation for future enhancements, including:  

Integration of machine learning for predictive recommendations  

Real-time data usage for dynamic suggestions  

Improved scalability to handle larger user bases and datasets  

Overall, it showcases a strong application of database concepts in building intelligent, user-focused systems.
